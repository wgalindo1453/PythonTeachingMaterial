        "  * A list is labelled with index. An index is like a label that helps you find something in your list. Just like you might put a label on your backpack to help you find what you need, you can use an index to find a specific item in a Python list. An index is a number that tells you where an item is located in the list. For example, if you have a list of five items, the first item is at index 0, the second item is at index 1, the third item is at index 2, and so on.\n",
